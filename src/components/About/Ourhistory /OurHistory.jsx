            <h4>The School was established in 1967 with one class in standard one. In 1969, there was no space for an office as classes occupied the three rooms. By 1970, under the leadership of Fr. Luigi Testa, Parish priest of Consolata Church, a block of eight classrooms, an office, a staff room and a dining hall with a kitchen was completed. At this stage the school had 144 pupils.

Over the years it has developed into a wonderful school capable of providing educational facilities to 1800 students. Sister Evelinna Garnneri was the first Headmistress up to the beginning of May 1973. She was succeeded by Sr. Giovanna Aurelia, who handed over the post to Sr. Miriam Depine in 1981. Fr. Anthony Giordano took over the running of the school in 1987. A new block of class rooms, an Art room, a library, a science room and a hall were completed.
With the introduction of the 8-4-4 system a 10 km school walk was planned. The aim was to raise funds to build and equip the workshop block with rooms for the practical work. This project was completed in 1984.
Fr. Attilio Benoni took over the running of the school in 1997. The school achieved success in all fields of education under his guidance. Some of the projects he pioneered; are like the commissioning of the Consolata high school in 1997, computerization and networking of both primary and high school Labs. He also introduced the swimming galas for each class to create more interest and competitive spirit among the students. </h4>
