          <h4> Primary School Program </h4>
        </div>
        The school follows the 8-4-4 system of Education and children are
        prepared for the K.C.P.E.(Kenya Certificate of Primary education). The
        system is structured in a way that within the eight years of primary
        education, lower primary (class I – III) evolves in upper primary
        (classes IV-VIII) which in turn will mature into the secondary school
        (Form I-IV). The Primary school curriculum encourages students to
        develop an understanding of key concepts in the following subjects: 1.
        LANGUAGE I English Grammar, reading, comprehension and Composition
        writing 2. LANGUAGE II Kiswahili Grammar, reading, comprehension and
        Composition writing 3. MATHEMATICS 4. SCIENCE 5. SOCIAL STUDIES
        (History, Civics, Geography, religion) • Our primary school program is
        based on an interactive child centred philosophy of education. Students
        are taught to discuss their ideas and be explorative as they learn. The
        teachers direct learning through questions and making careful
        observations meant to motivate students to be explorative as well as
        attentive and open minded. It is a program whose objective is achieving
        basic literacy and numeracy amongst all pupils, as well as establishing
        foundations in science, mathematics, geography, history and other social
        sciences. During primary school our students advance steadily from one
        class to the next and are placed in classes with one teacher responsible
        for their education and welfare in collaboration with other teachers.
        Each class teacher has responsibility for about 24 students and guides,
        oversees, and takes significant responsibility for their academic,
        personal, social and spiritual development. The class teacher is given
        early warning of any problems or difficulties a student is having and
        will, if necessary, inform parents promptly.
